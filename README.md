# LinkedIn Database Schema Design

## Project Description

This project contains the conceptual design and physical implementation of a simplified relational database for a professional networking platform similar to LinkedIn. The goal is to model core features such as users, professional experience, skills, posts, and interactions.

The repository includes:
* A conceptual **Entity-Relationship (ER) Diagram**.
* A complete **SQL script** for creating the database schema.

---

## ER Diagram

The visual blueprint for the database can be found in the file:
`LinkedIn ER Diagram.png` 

---

## Database Schema (SQL)

The complete SQL script with all `CREATE TABLE` statements can be found in the file:
`sql queries.db`

---

## How to Use

1.  Review the `LinkedIn ER Diagram.png` file to understand the database structure.
2.  Execute the `sql queries.db` script in a database management tool (like MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, etc.) to create all the tables.
